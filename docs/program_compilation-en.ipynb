    "# Program Compilation\n",
    "\n",
    "``BrainState`` enables cross-hardware compilation and deployment through ``brainstate.compile``, allowing Python code to be transformed into an intermediate representation (IR) and subsequently compiled and optimized for various hardware platforms (CPU, GPU and TPU).\n",
    "\n",
    "The compilation provided in ``BrainState`` is primarily integrated into ``brainstate.compile``. These compilation APIs encompass a range of syntactic functionalities, including:\n",
    "\t1.\tJust-in-Time Compilation (JIT): Supports JIT compilation to enhance computational efficiency and performance.\n",
    "\t2.\tConditional Statements: Enables if-else logic, allowing users to execute different computational processes based on varying conditions.\n",
    "\t3.\tLoop Statements: Supports for and while loops, enabling users to execute repetitive computational operations conveniently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The JAX framework itself offers highly practical transformation methods to optimize program performance ([Transformations](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/key-concepts.html#transformations)). Typically, JAX transformations operate on ``jax.Arrays`` within ``pytrees`` and adhere to value semantics. A significant portion of the computations in BrainPy relies on JAX. JAX provides Python programs with excellent transformations, including differentiation, vectorization, parallelization, and JIT compilation. However, JAX’s transformations are function-based rather than state-based. This means JAX cannot optimize ``State`` objects, as they are dynamically generated at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this limitation, BrainPy introduces ``brainstate.compile``, which compiles ``State`` objects into computational graphs, enabling their optimization. These compilation extensions enhance JAX transformations, allowing ``State`` objects to be passed into and out of transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key features of ``BrainState``’s compilation approach is its state-awareness: during program execution, any encountered ``State`` instance is compiled into the computational graph and executed on various hardware platforms. This compilation strategy empowers users to define arbitrarily complex programs, with the compiler optimizing based on actual runtime branches. This significantly improves computational efficiency. Moreover, the state-aware compilation model allows users to express program logic more flexibly without being constrained by concepts like `PyGraph` or ``PyTree``, thereby unlocking greater programming versatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we will delve into the specific usage of ``brainstate.compile``.\n"

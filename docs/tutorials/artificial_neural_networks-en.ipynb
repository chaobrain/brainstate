    "Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), also known as neural networks (NNs), in the fields of machine learning and cognitive science, are mathematical or computational models that mimic the structure and function of biological neural networks (especially the central nervous system of animals, particularly the brain) for estimating or approximating functions. Similar to how neurons in the human brain are interconnected, neurons in an artificial neural network are also interconnected in various layers of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to spiking neural networks, the neurons in artificial neural networks are simplified and do not have intrinsic dynamics. The information transmitted between neurons is not discrete action potentials (0 or 1), but continuous floating-point numbers, which can be understood as the firing rate of a neuron at a given time step. Although artificial neural networks were originally inspired by biological brains and can exhibit some properties of biological brains, they are primarily used as powerful models to solve specific problems without focusing on how their parts correspond to biological systems.\n",

    "## Architecture of Artificial Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The neurons in artificial neural networks are distributed across different layers, and information propagates forward layer by layer. These layers can be categorized into three types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input Layer: The first layer of the artificial neural network, which receives input and passes it to the hidden layers.\n",
    "- Hidden Layers: These layers perform various computations and feature extraction on the input received from the input layer. Typically, there are multiple hidden layers through which the information flows sequentially.\n",
    "- Output Layer: Finally, the output layer receives information from the hidden layers, performs computations, and provides the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "    <img src=\"../_static/artificial-neural-network-tutorial3.png\" alt=\"ann2\" />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the type of computation, there are many different kinds of layers in an artificial neural network. The simplest type of layer is the linear layer. After receiving the input, the linear layer computes the weighted sum of the inputs, adds a bias term, and produces the output. This can be expressed by the formula:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{\\mathrm{i=1}}^{\\mathrm{n}}\\mathrm{W_i}*\\mathrm{X_i}+\\mathrm{b}。\\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This dot product and summation are linear operations. If more layers are added but only linear operations are used, adding layers will have no effect, as they can be equivalently reduced to a single linear transformation due to the commutative and associative properties. Therefore, we need to add a nonlinear **activation function** to increase the expressive power of the model. The activation function determines whether a neuron is activated. Only activated neurons will have (non-zero) outputs, which is analogous to biological neurons. There are various types of activation functions to choose from, depending on the task. In the neural network implementation in this tutorial, we will use ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and Softmax activation functions, which will be explained in more detail later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow of Artificial Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial neural networks are data-driven statistical models. We train the model to solve problems not by explicitly writing rules, but by providing training data and allowing the model to learn the solution method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we provide a dataset that specifies the input-output relationship, run the model to obtain its current output, and use the **loss function** to compute the difference between the model’s output and the correct output. Then, using the **backpropagation** method, we compute the partial derivatives of the parameters (mainly weights $W$ and biases $b$) layer by layer to obtain the magnitude and direction of parameter optimization. Finally, the **optimizer** is used to optimize the parameters so that the model’s output is as close as possible to the standard output provided by the dataset."

    "After the artificial neural network receives an image input, it outputs a classification result. We need to compare this result with the ground truth and optimize the parameters to make the predicted class probabilities as close as possible to the true classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "During this process, the **loss function** measures the difference between the predicted class probabilities and the true classes. There are many types of loss functions to choose from, depending on the output and task. Here, we use the common cross-entropy loss function for multi-class classification tasks. For a single sample, the formula for the cross-entropy loss is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Loss(y_i, \\hat{y_i}) = - \\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \\log(\\hat{y_i})\\tag{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{y_i}$ is the predicted probability distribution (the sum of probabilities for all classes is 1), $y_i$ is the true class label (using One-Hot encoding, where only the correct class has a value of 1, and the others are 0), and $N$ is the number of classes. If the model predicts correctly (the probability for the true class is close to 1), the loss will be small; conversely, if the predicted probability for the true class is close to 0, the loss will be large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the model output provided to the loss function is not directly the probability value (the sum of probabilities is not constrained to 1). This is because the loss function `softmax_cross_entropy_with_integer_labels` in `braintools.metric` automatically applies the softmax activation function to convert the model's output into a probability distribution. The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{z}$ is the input vector, $z_i$ is the $i$-th element of the input vector, and $K$ is the dimension of the input vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, `softmax_cross_entropy_with_integer_labels` can also automatically convert a 1D true class label into One-Hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backpropagation Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backpropagation** is the key algorithm used to optimize parameters during neural network training. Its main task is to compute the gradients of each parameter (mainly the weights $W$ and biases $b$) based on the value of the loss function. This algorithm traces the source of the model's prediction error to optimize the parameters. After obtaining the loss value, backpropagation uses the chain rule to compute the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to each parameter, layer by layer. These partial derivatives (gradients) describe the direction and magnitude of the loss function's change with respect to the parameters and form the basis for optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "The **optimizer** is an algorithm that determines how to update the network's parameters (mainly weights and biases) using the gradients to reduce the loss value. The basic update rule is:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "w=w-\\eta\\cdot\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w}\\tag{5}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $w$ is a parameter, $\\eta$ is the learning rate, and $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w}$ is the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many types of optimizers available, and here we choose the commonly used Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer.\n",
    "\n",

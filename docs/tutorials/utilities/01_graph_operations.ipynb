    "# BrainState Graph and Node System\n",
    "\n",
    "In JAX, powerful function transformations are applicable to pytree data structures -- such as dictionaries, lists, tuples, and other tree-like forms. Leveraging pytree, JAX enables efficient automatic differentiation, vectorization, and parallelization. However, many practical applications, particularly complex neural network models and physical systems, are better suited to graph representations rather than simple tree structures. To address this need, the `brainstate` library adopts the graph-based representation in [flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/) to represent complex model architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is `pygraph`?\n",
    "\n",
    "`pygraph` is a specialized data structure within `brainstate` designed to facilitate JAX transformations for graph-based models. Unlike conventional tree structures, graphs can articulate a broader range of node relationships and dependencies, making them ideal for more intricate model architectures. In scenarios where a model's state relies on the interactions among multiple nodes, graph structures offer enhanced flexibility in representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pygraph` module utilizes **`brainstate.graph.Node`** as its foundational element, constructing graph structures by defining relationships (edges) between nodes. Each node can hold arbitrary pytree array data or nested `pygraph` substructures, promoting a more adaptable and modular approach to graph construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of `brainstate.graph.Node` as a **container class**, where its attributes denote its leaf nodes. These containers can reference one another, thereby facilitating the creation of complex graph structures."

If the value should be included in the `filter`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to simplify the creation of `filter` functions, `brainstate` provides a small domain-specific language (DSL). This allows users to pass types, boolean values, ellipses, tuples/lists, etc., which are internally converted into the corresponding predicates.\n",

    "| `(*filters)` (tuple) or `[*filters]` (list) | Matches values satisfying any of the internal `filters` |\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "`PyGraph` is a data structure specifically designed in the `brainstate` library to provide JAX function transformation support for complex graph structures. Its core value lies in:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Flexible Expression of Graph Structures\n",
    "- Compared to traditional tree structures (pytree), graph structures can represent more complex node relationships and dependencies\n",
    "- Supports cyclic references, making it suitable for expressing complex model structures like RNNs\n",
    "- Nodes can contain arbitrary pytree array data or subgraph structures\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Seamless Integration with the JAX Ecosystem\n",
    "- Supports JAX's core functionalities, including automatic differentiation, vectorization, and parallelization\n",
    "- Provides a mechanism for converting between graph structures and pytree via `treefy_split` and `treefy_merge`\n",
    "- Natively supports JAX function transformations such as `jit`, `vmap`, and `grad`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Rich API for Graph Operations\n",
    "- **Structure operations**: `graphdef`, `iter_node`, `iter_leaf`, `nodes`, `states`\n",
    "- **Transformations**: `treefy_states`, `clone`, `treefy_split`, `treefy_merge`, `flatten`, `unflatten`\n",
    "- **Modifications**: `pop_states`, `update_states`\n",
    "- **Conversions**: `graph_to_tree`, `tree_to_graph`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Powerful Filter System\n",
    "- Filter by type: `brainstate.ParamState`, `brainstate.ShortTermState`, etc.\n",
    "- Combine filters: Use tuples/lists for \"any\" logic\n",
    "- Match everything: `...` or `True`\n",
    "- Match nothing: `None` or `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Structure preserving state management\n",
    "- Separate graph structure (`graphdef`) from state values (`treefy_states`)\n",
    "- Retrieve states according to state filters\n"

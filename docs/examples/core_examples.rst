Core examples
=============

Core examples are hosted on the GitHub repository in the `examples <https://github.com/chaobrain/brainstate/tree/main/examples>`__
directory.

Each example is designed to be **self-contained and easily forkable**.

Examples including models fom deep learning, brain simulation, and brain-inspired computing.

Some of the examples below have a link "InteractiveðŸ•¹" that lets you run them
directly in Colab.

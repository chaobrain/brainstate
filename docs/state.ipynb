    "\n",
    "``State`` is a key data structure in ``BrainState`` used to encapsulate state variables in models. These variables primarily represent values that change over time within the model. A ``State`` can wrap any Python data type, such as integers, floating-point numbers, arrays, ``jax.Array``, or any of these encapsulated in dictionaries or arrays. Unlike native Python data structures, the data within a ``State`` object remains mutable after program compilation.\n",

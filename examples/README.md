# Examples for ``brainstate`` library


We provide several kinds of examples to demonstrate the usage of the ``brainstate`` library. The examples are organized in the following categories:

- The files with name started with ``0__`` are the examples for deep neural networks.
- The files with name started with ``1__`` are the examples for brain simulation models, especially spiking neural networks.
- The files with name started with ``2__`` are the examples for brain-inspired computing models, especially training spiking neural networks.
- The files with name started with ``3__`` are the examples for rate-based recurrent neural networks.
